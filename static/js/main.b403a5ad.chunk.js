Please advise on destination of cargo.\u201d",n.a.createElement(me,null)),n.a.createElement(U,null),n.a.createElement(ce,null,'You nodded away the AR world created by your wetware and grab the harness which holds you in the chair suspended in the middle of the bridge. you clicke chest restraints of the harness and push off towards the storage room hatch. Well, storage room was a stretch. It was more a repurposed closet, but it worked for your needs. Right before you plowed into the hatch, you reached out and stopped myself with your arms, quickly grabbing a hand hold. you punched open the hatch and started going through items trying to find your EVA gear. \u201cI am rigging for EVA. I will update you when target is captured.\u201d \u201cSAM, end message. Send message.\u201d \u201cAcknowledged. Message response will take at least 32 minutes 46 seconds. Reminder: Time to closest approach, T minus 1 minute 3 seconds.\u201d \u201cShit, SAM". It took longer to get your suit on than you thought. You pause, thinking for a second. \u201cI guess I gotta cut some corners on the procedures.\u201d You clicked your helmet on. Through the sixth sense of the wet-ware, you could feel the suit interface with the computers embedded within me. \u201cSAM, blow atmosphere on the bridge. Prepare for pilot EVA. Set attitude mode: inertial.\u201d \u201cAcknowledged.\u201d Sounds muffled and then disappeared as the atmosphere inside the ship thinned. Over the past few days, you had had SAM run an acclimatization procedure to get me used to the pressure suit\u2019s atmosphere. This meant you didn\u2019t have to wait to put on the pressure suit. Which meant we could have fun quicker. you turned in place, facing the exterior hatch. you reached out with the sixth sense of your wet-ware and tried to move forward. A swarm of cold-gas thrusters fired in patterns, pushing me forward at a steady walking speed. you grabbed the panel for the outside hatch in AR. It popped open a bit red button. you love big red buttons. And pressing them. you pressed it. The hatch opened slowly. Even though you had just seen it in AR, you always felt the stars looked better in person. you moved outside on a cloud of cold gas thrusters. Ahead, the view of the target was blocked by the mass of the radiator fins of your own ship. Which was nice because you would rather they block any stray rems coming off your reactor. Around them, you could catch a glimpse of a massive rectangular block. The ship was painted a reflective white color, causing it shine brightly in the harsh sunlight of space. At one of end of the block, you could just make out the cones of multiple drive blocks. you could just start to see a forest of attentae around the front. \u201cSAM, start message. CAPCOM. Alpha kilo echo 42 23. you can\u2019t read target\u2019s transponder. you have visual on target. Target appears intact and does not have any visible damage to comms. Array. Please advise on the nature of the target.\u201d you looked through AR at the target. The ship\u2019s telescopes kicked into action and your field of vision zoomed towards it. It was definitely a cargo carrier of some sort. Not a bulk carrier, like mine, designed for long hauls and lots of cargo. Rather this was something designed to move something discreetly and quickly through the system. State of the art, too, judging from the equipment you could see on the outside. Much more efficient fusion drive. No need for bulky radiators like your girl. \u201cTarget is a, uh\u2026, cargo ship of some sort. Tail number is not visible to ship\u2019s telescopes.\u201d Just then, something clicked into place. How could you be so dumb? Second law of thermodynamics, stupid. \u201cAdditional information, CAPCOM. No external signs of reactor activity, and radiators are dark. She\u2019s been powered down for a while. Man, looks like this tow is gonna take a while.\u201d you said the last part mostly to myself. \u201cJames. T minus 15 seconds to closest approach.\u201d SAM chimed in. you nodded away the AR image of the ship, but could see it wasn\u2019t really needed. The ship loomed large behind the radiator fins. you turned your back to the ship, looking away from the direction of travel. you reached out to your boots with your sixth sense and engaged the electromagnetic coils buried within them. you reached out in AR and grabbed onto the magnetic tether. you felt a tingle of pins as your arm and the robotic arm become one. you counted down the seconds silently to myself as a field on the visor of your suit did the same. Everything was quiet except the low hum of the suit\u2019s environment control systems and the sound of your own breath. In the shadow of your ship, you could look out at the infinite field of stars in the sky. Of course, you could see them whenever you wanted in AR, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cT minus 3, 2, 1. Mark.\u201d SAM cut in again. you didn\u2019t have time to scold him for breaking your perfect moment. The ship whizzed past me. you glanced at your wrist in AR to ensure that the mode for the reel was not set to \u201cBRAKE\u201d. you didn\u2019t want to be thrown off the ship by snagging this guy. you put your hand out in front of me with your palm out. The magnetic tether\u2019s robotic arm mirrored mine exactly. you reached out with your sixth sense and called on it to fire. you felt a sudden jolt in the bones of your body as the rocket pack on the end of the tether fired. The familiar staccato patterns of thrusters immediately started to work against it. you could see end of the tether flying off after the ship through the ship\u2019s telescopes. It flapped this way and that way as though fluttering in breezes of cold nitrogen gas. you reached out with your sixth sense, guiding it towards the receding ship. you felt the end of the tether attach to the target through your sixth sense. It was as though your hand had grown a sucker and using it you had sucked onto the cold metal side of ship. Immediately, you could feel the cable being pulled by the inertia of our two ships parting. you wasn\u2019t in a big rush to stop out ships from parting. you had kilometers of cable to spare in the tether. you was free to use the tether\u2019s BRAKE mode. Hidden within the tether\u2019s drum was thick oil. Using a fan to turn against the viscosity of the oil, you could dump our difference in inertia into heat energy. Second law of thermodynamics, ladies and gentlemen! However--due to a literal alignment of planets--you had fuel to spare on this mission. you reached towards the ships thrusters and willed the ship to thrust against our direction of travel again. The thrust came in waves through your boots. The ship started dropping away from me. Appearing to move upwards as our orbital speeds changed. you moved the vector of thrust for the ship to compensate. you could see the ship become still against the field of stars. \u201cSAM, re-engage inertial hold mode.\u201d \u201cAcknowledged.\u201d Again, you looked at your wrist. you flicked the mode on the magnetic tether to \u201cBRAKE\u201d and released control on the magnetic tether. you unlocked your boots from the thick steel panels that made up the outside of the bridge and turned towards the platform of the magnetic tether. you floated forwards. Now that we\u2019ve zero-d our relative velocity, there\u2019s no need to hurry. \u201cSAM. Please remind me when the round-trip light delay interval is over. you want to know when you should expect to hear back from CAPCOM.\u201d \u201cRoger. Your first message will reach Dispatch in about 14 minutes. The minimum time to response is about 30 minutes.\u201d you thought for a second. \u201cSAM, did you just change the way you speak? You just used \u2018Roger\u2019, not \u2018Acknowledged\u2019\u201d. \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you mean, James.\u201d Being this far out from civilization was starting to creep me out. Maybe it\u2019s the silence of working in zero atmosphere or the atmosphere of living with your own breath, but working in a suit for long periods of times can make one prone to superstition. you reached down to your belt and grabbed a tool. It looked like a trapezoid made out of fat aluminum tubes. It had an arrangement of 4 pulleys at each of the vertices of the trapezoid. The Handi-Tether Traversal Tool\u2122 was the fastest and cheapest way across the gap. In the seconds that it took the tether to fly, we had lost a lot of meters. you could have used AR to check it, but you figured we had at least a kilometer to go. \u201cTake care, James\u201d \u201cSAM, you swear you\u2019re acting weird. Standby for now.\u201d \u201cOk, James\u201d you clicked the tether onto the steel cabling coming out from the top of the mechanical arm. you checked the battery panel on the side. Nearly 100% battery. Good. Not that you\u2019m worried. The Handi-Tether Traversal Tool\u2122 has \u2018Patent-pending super-Solar tech! Guaranteed not to need charging for at least 10 years!\u2019. At least that\u2019s what a company sales rep told me before you bought it. you\u2019ve never actually seen any solar panels on this thing now that you\u2019ve thought about it. you braced myself through your sixth sense. The bio-muscles on your suit tensed up and locked in place around the grip you had on the tool. you pushed a button on the panel of the tool. you started zipping off towards the distant ship. \u201cSAM, start another message.\u201d \u201cCAPCOM, you\u2019ve rendezvoused with the target, and am currently progressing along the tether. Target has not responded to standard salvage hail. you am proceeding with mission. Please advise about final disposition of cargo. In the meantime, you am going to investigate propellent reserves onboard and then try to restart the reactor core.\u201d \u201cSAM, send message.\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ve sent that message for you, James.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again SAM! What\u2019s going on. You never talk like this.\u201d \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you mean, James.\u201d \u201cDeactivate yourself, SAM. you\u2019ll take a look at you later.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, James.\u201d \u201cBut keep the radio live.\u201d you quickly added after thinking for a second. My comment was met with silence. you assumed that he heard that. you looked towards the brilliant white ship. The starfield darkened as the sun filters in your helmet adapted to the strong light. you suddenly felt as though you was examining a model against black velvet. you zoomed in with ships telescopes and scanned the exterior again. you could now see that the ship\u2019s skin which had looked completely smooth from a distance was actually made of little square panels. you searched the entire surface of the ship, looking for some break or indication of entry point, but there were no marks and nothing of note other than the regular grid of squares. you noticed that you was already well past the halfway point of the tether. you reached out to the humming tool and flipped a switch inside it with your mind. The braking force from the device rolled through your arms. The little AI of the tool was having to use way more force than normal since you\u2019d overshot your mark. The surface of the ship loomed large in front of me. you couldn\u2019t help but think of it as the arch of firmament, with me rushing headlong up towards it. you mentally reached out thinking \u201cBRAKE\u201d. It didn\u2019t do anything since this dumb little tool doesn\u2019t have a sixth sense attachment, but the little AI was smart enough to bring me to a stop without flinging me off the wire. The tetherpack had hit almost exactly in the center of ship. you engaged your magnetic boots and knelt down to look at the panel. Suddenly, you was spinning. As you tumbled, it clicked in your head that your boots had not stuck to the panel. you activated the suit\u2019s thrusters. My spin was quickly arrested. you looked back at the tetherpack. It had landed hard and had punched through a panel. It seemed to be clinging to some internal piece of machinery. \u2018So the panels aren\u2019t very strong\u2019. you thought. \u2018Let\u2019s try another way in\u2019. Hey. They pay us as long as the cargo\u2019s intact. \u201cExternal skin appears to be non-ferromagnetic. No indication of any airlock. Was not expecting this CAPCOM. you\u2019m going to try another way in.\u201d you floated up the panel. you could see tiny screws barely visible in the panel. Each carefully painted to match the color of panel. you reached out with your glove. you used your sixth sense to select a glove tool. My gloved fingertip reformed as it became as screwdriver bit. you carefully removed the screws and stored them. Always helps to clean up in space. you tugged at the panel and finally engaged the suit\u2019s bio-muscles. The panel finally came free. you poked your head in. \u201cyou see. CAPCOM, you have breached the outer hull, but target is double-halled. you\u2019m going to investigate the inner hull for an entry. you will advise when you\u2019ve gained entry into the ship.\u201d As you gripped onto the edge of hole you\u2019d made in the outer hull, you could feel a jerk come through the hull. you then felt a series of vibrating tugs. you could almost swear you heard a shrill creaking noise. Obviously that couldn\u2019t be the case though. There\u2019s no noise in space. Must be vibrations from thrusters of your ship through the cable. you remember that you\u2019d told SAM to hold position though. So what caused the ship to move? you think you\u2019ve been in this game for too long. These deep space solo jobs will get to you. Some of the old timers used to say it was staring at the stars for too long. Lots of scientists say it\u2019s the cosmic radiation you get from years in the suit. you, for one, am leaving the jury out on it for now. Don\u2019t signal to stop the bus unless you want to get off. The inner hull was dark and cramped. Unlike the featureless outer hull, the inner hull had tangles of equipment, pipes, and wires weaved through it. you had to move and dodge as you moved along try to find the goal of your current step in the mission. Now that you\u2019d moved inside a bit, you could barely see your hand in front of me in visible light. However, your suit could see in a wide band of EM bands, so you could still see the contours of it through your sixth sense, the image inferred through a synthesis of heat, radio, and other sensors. you could make out the outline of a panel on the inner hull. No power, no AR. No work. you opened up the panel and grabbed the manual release lever. Not a big red button, but you can work with it. you pumped the manual release lever using the enhanced strength of the suit. The oil gushed through the system, moving various parts of the system until you saw six pins around the circular hatch pop out. you turned the lever and pushed in. The hatch itself slowly started to float away from its mount. you pulled the lever on the hatch to swing it open fully. you rushed towards the hatch. Inside, you could see the pale green screen of the airlock hanging in the inky black. \u201cOk, so the airlock is running on internal batteries only. you repeat, ship appears to have no battery backups active. Airlocks are in emergency mode.\u201d you reached out of the airlock panel with your sixth sense. For a second nothing happened. \u201cOh yeah. Emergency mode doesn\u2019t have enough power for AR.\u201d you said to myself. you punched \u201cFAST CYCLE\u201d on the airlock. The outside hatch automatically started to close. you jerked it close and turned the lever. As it locked, you hear a thin, high \u2018beep\u2019 as the airlock cycled. \u201cSAM--check atmospheric content.\u201d No need to waste vacuum time if you don\u2019t have to. you waited for a few seconds. \u201cSAM?\u201d Apparently he took the command to turn himself off pretty seriously. Or he\u2019s ignoring me. He sure is acting weird today. you looked down at your wrist through AR. you could see a readout for the atmosphere sensors. you added it all up in your head and nodded to myself. As you clicked the helmet off, the AR overview slide away. Without the helmet muffing the sounds around me--that\u2019s when you realized what was was bugging me about this ship. It was completely silent. you\u2019d been inside powered down ships before, but never one with all the batteries drained like this. Every ship has large battery backup units and solar panels which automatically deploy in the event of main engine power failures. Without your helmet\u2019s displays and sensors, My world changed from bright and multicolored to pitch black. The panel on the airlock cast a small pool of green light around me, sending out deep shadows. There\u2019s an old saying among spacers. \u2018Just as a body without breath is a corpse, a ship without power is a coffin.\u2019 Sitting in the quiet of the ship, you felt a chill go down your spine as you remembered this saying. But you had a job to do, and you wasn\u2019t going to let something like that get the better of me. \u201cCAPCOM, ship is completely dark. you\u2019ve never seen a ship so drained. She must have been on the float for a while, huh? The emergency solars must not have deployed. you\u2019m going to head to engineering to see if you can get some power in here.\u201d'),n.a.createElement(U,null)))},fe=function(e){var t=e.children;return n.a.createElement(se.a,{align:"center",variant:"h1"},t)},ge=function(e){var t=e.children;return n.a.createElement(se.a,{align:"center",variant:"h4"},t)},we=function(e){return n.a.createElement(L,Object.assign({entry:"title-page"},e),n.a.createElement($,{uid:"title-page"},n.a.createElement(ce,null,n.a.createElement(fe,null,"Fenris"),n.a.createElement(me,null),n.a.createElement(ge,null,"By Jon Monroe")),n.a.createElement(he,null,"Start"),n.a.createElement(X,{section:"help-text"})),n.a.createElement($,{uid:"help-text"},n.a.createElement(ce,null,"The following is an interactive narrative experience.",n.a.createElement(me,null),"The application automatically saves your progress.",n.a.createElement(me,null),"Blue buttons indicate choices you can make.",n.a.createElement(me,null),"Red buttons indicate checkpoints you can restart from.",n.a.createElement(me,null)),n.a.createElement(he,null,"I understand"),n.a.createElement(U,null)))},be=function(e){return n.a.createElement(L,Object.assign({entry:"end"},e),n.a.createElement($,{uid:"end"},n.a.createElement(ce,null,"To Be Continued!")))},ve=function(){return n.a.createElement(H,null,n.a.createElement(we,null),n.a.createElement(ye,null),n.a.createElement(be,null))},ke=a(42),Ee=a(41),Ae=a.n(Ee),Se=Object(ke.a)({palette:{primary:{main:"#005276"},secondary:{main:"#BB2400"},background:{default:Ae.a[800]}},typography:{fontFamily:"Courier New,Courier,Lucida Sans Typewriter,Lucida Typewriter,monospace",h1:{fontSize:"5rem"}}}),Te=Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));function Ce(e,t){navigator.serviceWorker.register(e).then((function(e){e.onupdatefound=function(){var a=e.installing;null!=a&&(a.onstatechange=function(){"installed"===a.state&&(navigator.serviceWorker.controller?(console.log("New content is available and will be used when all tabs for this page are closed.
