Next, came the radiation-shielding\n        Section. Six massive silica radiator fins rose out like from the truss\n        like petals on a flower. All of them glowing red hot from dissipating\n        the heat of the reactor during braking. My little red void rose, you\n        thought. Then, came the radiation shielding proper in the form of both\n        large magnetic coils as well a large sheets of high density metals just\n        for good measure. Finally, came the portion you always allocated for\n        mission equipment. Bolted to the side of the truss was a large yellow\n        platform with a large reel of steel cable. A hingle and massive\n        hydraulic cylinders connected the platform with a mechanical arm. At the\n        end of the arm, was a large disc connected to a thruster pack. you had\n        once see videos of electromagnetic cranes used in junkyards on Earth\n        from the late 20th century. you had been struck by how similar it looked\n        to the magnetic tether. you picked up the glowing white bubble sitting\n        above the crane arm and held it in front it me. you squeezed the bubble\n        and activating the crane. you then moved your arm around.

Well, storage room was a stretch. It was more a\n        repurposed closet, but it worked for your needs. Right before you plowed\n        into the hatch, you reached out and stopped myself with your arms,\n        quickly grabbing a hand hold. you punched open the hatch and started\n        going through items trying to find your EVA gear. “I am rigging for EVA.\n        I will update you when target is captured.” “SAM, end message. Send\n        message.” “Acknowledged. Message response will take at least 32 minutes\n        46 seconds. Reminder: Time to closest approach, T minus 1 minute 3\n        seconds.” “Shit, SAM\". It took longer to get your suit on than you\n        thought. You pause, thinking for a second. “I guess I gotta cut some\n        corners on the procedures.” You clicked your helmet on. Through the\n        sixth sense of the wet-ware, you could feel the suit interface with the\n        computers embedded within me. “SAM, blow atmosphere on the bridge.\n        Prepare for pilot EVA. Set attitude mode: inertial.” “Acknowledged.”\n        Sounds muffled and then disappeared as the atmosphere inside the ship\n        thinned. Over the past few days, you had had SAM run an acclimatization\n        procedure to get me used to the pressure suit’s atmosphere. This meant\n        you didn’t have to wait to put on the pressure suit. Which meant we\n        could have fun quicker. you turned in place, facing the exterior hatch.\n        you reached out with the sixth sense of your wet-ware and tried to move\n        forward. A swarm of cold-gas thrusters fired in patterns, pushing me\n        forward at a steady walking speed. you grabbed the panel for the outside\n        hatch in AR. It popped open a bit red button. you love big red buttons.\n        And pressing them. you pressed it. The hatch opened slowly. Even though\n        you had just seen it in AR, you always felt the stars looked better in\n        person. you moved outside on a cloud of cold gas thrusters. Ahead, the\n        view of the target was blocked by the mass of the radiator fins of your\n        own ship. Which was nice because you would rather they block any stray\n        rems coming off your reactor. Around them, you could catch a glimpse of\n        a massive rectangular block. The ship was painted a reflective white\n        color, causing it shine brightly in the harsh sunlight of space. At one\n        of end of the block, you could just make out the cones of multiple drive\n        blocks. you could just start to see a forest of attentae around the\n        front. “SAM, start message. CAPCOM. Alpha kilo echo 42 23. you can’t\n        read target’s transponder. you have visual on target. Target appears\n        intact and does not have any visible damage to comms. Array. Please\n        advise on the nature of the target.” you looked through AR at the\n        target. The ship’s telescopes kicked into action and your field of\n        vision zoomed towards it. It was definitely a cargo carrier of some\n        sort. Not a bulk carrier, like mine, designed for long hauls and lots of\n        cargo. Rather this was something designed to move something discreetly\n        and quickly through the system. State of the art, too, judging from the\n        equipment you could see on the outside. Much more efficient fusion\n        drive. No need for bulky radiators like your girl. “Target is a, uh…,\n        cargo ship of some sort. Tail number is not visible to ship’s\n        telescopes.” Just then, something clicked into place. How could you be\n        so dumb? Second law of thermodynamics, stupid. “Additional information,\n        CAPCOM. No external signs of reactor activity, and radiators are dark.\n        She’s been powered down for a while. Man, looks like this tow is gonna\n        take a while.” you said the last part mostly to myself. “James. T minus\n        15 seconds to closest approach.” SAM chimed in. you nodded away the AR\n        image of the ship, but could see it wasn’t really needed. The ship\n        loomed large behind the radiator fins. you turned your back to the ship,\n        looking away from the direction of travel. you reached out to your boots\n        with your sixth sense and engaged the electromagnetic coils buried\n        within them. you reached out in AR and grabbed onto the magnetic tether.\n        you felt a tingle of pins as your arm and the robotic arm become one.\n        you counted down the seconds silently to myself as a field on the visor\n        of your suit did the same. Everything was quiet except the low hum of\n        the suit’s environment control systems and the sound of your own breath.\n        In the shadow of your ship, you could look out at the infinite field of\n        stars in the sky. Of course, you could see them whenever you wanted in\n        AR, but it wasn’t the same. “T minus 3, 2, 1. Mark.” SAM cut in again.\n        you didn’t have time to scold him for breaking your perfect moment. The\n        ship whizzed past me. you glanced at your wrist in AR to ensure that the\n        mode for the reel was not set to “BRAKE”. you didn’t want to be thrown\n        off the ship by snagging this guy. you put your hand out in front of me\n        with your palm out. The magnetic tether’s robotic arm mirrored mine\n        exactly. you reached out with your sixth sense and called on it to fire.\n        you felt a sudden jolt in the bones of your body as the rocket pack on\n        the end of the tether fired. The familiar staccato patterns of thrusters\n        immediately started to work against it. you could see end of the tether\n        flying off after the ship through the ship’s telescopes. It flapped this\n        way and that way as though fluttering in breezes of cold nitrogen gas.\n        you reached out with your sixth sense, guiding it towards the receding\n        ship. you felt the end of the tether attach to the target through your\n        sixth sense. It was as though your hand had grown a sucker and using it\n        you had sucked onto the cold metal side of ship. Immediately, you could\n        feel the cable being pulled by the inertia of our two ships parting. you\n        wasn’t in a big rush to stop out ships from parting. you had kilometers\n        of cable to spare in the tether. you was free to use the tether’s BRAKE\n        mode. Hidden within the tether’s drum was thick oil. Using a fan to turn\n        against the viscosity of the oil, you could dump our difference in\n        inertia into heat energy. Second law of thermodynamics, ladies and\n        gentlemen! However--due to a literal alignment of planets--you had fuel\n        to spare on this mission. you reached towards the ships thrusters and\n        willed the ship to thrust against our direction of travel again. The\n        thrust came in waves through your boots. The ship started dropping away\n        from me. Appearing to move upwards as our orbital speeds changed. you\n        moved the vector of thrust for the ship to compensate. you could see the\n        ship become still against the field of stars. “SAM, re-engage inertial\n        hold mode.” “Acknowledged.” Again, you looked at your wrist. you flicked\n        the mode on the magnetic tether to “BRAKE” and released control on the\n        magnetic tether. you unlocked your boots from the thick steel panels\n        that made up the outside of the bridge and turned towards the platform\n        of the magnetic tether. you floated forwards. Now that we’ve zero-d our\n        relative velocity, there’s no need to hurry. “SAM. Please remind me when\n        the round-trip light delay interval is over. you want to know when you\n        should expect to hear back from CAPCOM.” “Roger. Your first message will\n        reach Dispatch in about 14 minutes. The minimum time to response is\n        about 30 minutes.” you thought for a second. “SAM, did you just change\n        the way you speak? You just used ‘Roger’, not ‘Acknowledged’”. “you\n        don’t know what you mean, James.” Being this far out from civilization\n        was starting to creep me out. Maybe it’s the silence of working in zero\n        atmosphere or the atmosphere of living with your own breath, but working\n        in a suit for long periods of times can make one prone to superstition.\n        you reached down to your belt and grabbed a tool. It looked like a\n        trapezoid made out of fat aluminum tubes. It had an arrangement of 4\n        pulleys at each of the vertices of the trapezoid. The Handi-Tether\n        Traversal Tool™ was the fastest and cheapest way across the gap. In the\n        seconds that it took the tether to fly, we had lost a lot of meters. you\n        could have used AR to check it, but you figured we had at least a\n        kilometer to go. “Take care, James” “SAM, you swear you’re acting weird.\n        Standby for now.” “Ok, James” you clicked the tether onto the steel\n        cabling coming out from the top of the mechanical arm. you checked the\n        battery panel on the side. Nearly 100% battery. Good. Not that you’m\n        worried. The Handi-Tether Traversal Tool™ has ‘Patent-pending\n        super-Solar tech! Guaranteed not to need charging for at least 10\n        years!’. At least that’s what a company sales rep told me before you\n        bought it. you’ve never actually seen any solar panels on this thing now\n        that you’ve thought about it. you braced myself through your sixth\n        sense. The bio-muscles on your suit tensed up and locked in place around\n        the grip you had on the tool. you pushed a button on the panel of the\n        tool. you started zipping off towards the distant ship. “SAM, start\n        another message.” “CAPCOM, you’ve rendezvoused with the target, and am\n        currently progressing along the tether. Target has not responded to\n        standard salvage hail. you am proceeding with mission. Please advise\n        about final disposition of cargo. In the meantime, you am going to\n        investigate propellent reserves onboard and then try to restart the\n        reactor core.” “SAM, send message.” “you’ve sent that message for you,\n        James.” “You’re doing it again SAM! What’s going on. You never talk like\n        this.” “you don’t know what you mean, James.” “Deactivate yourself, SAM.\n        you’ll take a look at you later.” “If that’s what you want, James.” “But\n        keep the radio live.” you quickly added after thinking for a second. My\n        comment was met with silence. you assumed that he heard that. you looked\n        towards the brilliant white ship. The starfield darkened as the sun\n        filters in your helmet adapted to the strong light. you suddenly felt as\n        though you was examining a model against black velvet. you zoomed in\n        with ships telescopes and scanned the exterior again. you could now see\n        that the ship’s skin which had looked completely smooth from a distance\n        was actually made of little square panels. you searched the entire\n        surface of the ship, looking for some break or indication of entry\n        point, but there were no marks and nothing of note other than the\n        regular grid of squares. you noticed that you was already well past the\n        halfway point of the tether. you reached out to the humming tool and\n        flipped a switch inside it with your mind. The braking force from the\n        device rolled through your arms. The little AI of the tool was having to\n        use way more force than normal since you’d overshot your mark. The\n        surface of the ship loomed large in front of me. you couldn’t help but\n        think of it as the arch of firmament, with me rushing headlong up\n        towards it. you mentally reached out thinking “BRAKE”. It didn’t do\n        anything since this dumb little tool doesn’t have a sixth sense\n        attachment, but the little AI was smart enough to bring me to a stop\n        without flinging me off the wire. The tetherpack had hit almost exactly\n        in the center of ship. you engaged your magnetic boots and knelt down to\n        look at the panel. Suddenly, you was spinning. As you tumbled, it\n        clicked in your head that your boots had not stuck to the panel. you\n        activated the suit’s thrusters. My spin was quickly arrested. you looked\n        back at the tetherpack. It had landed hard and had punched through a\n        panel. It seemed to be clinging to some internal piece of machinery. ‘So\n        the panels aren’t very strong’. you thought. ‘Let’s try another way in’.\n        Hey. They pay us as long as the cargo’s intact. “External skin appears\n        to be non-ferromagnetic. No indication of any airlock. Was not expecting\n        this CAPCOM. you’m going to try another way in.” you floated up the\n        panel. you could see tiny screws barely visible in the panel. Each\n        carefully painted to match the color of panel. you reached out with your\n        glove. you used your sixth sense to select a glove tool. My gloved\n        fingertip reformed as it became as screwdriver bit. you carefully\n        removed the screws and stored them. Always helps to clean up in space.\n        you tugged at the panel and finally engaged the suit’s bio-muscles. The\n        panel finally came free. you poked your head in. “you see. CAPCOM, you\n        have breached the outer hull, but target is double-halled. you’m going\n        to investigate the inner hull for an entry. you will advise when you’ve\n        gained entry into the ship.” As you gripped onto the edge of hole you’d\n        made in the outer hull, you could feel a jerk come through the hull. you\n        then felt a series of vibrating tugs. you could almost swear you heard a\n        shrill creaking noise. Obviously that couldn’t be the case though.\n        There’s no noise in space. Must be vibrations from thrusters of your\n        ship through the cable. you remember that you’d told SAM to hold\n        position though. So what caused the ship to move? you think you’ve been\n        in this game for too long. These deep space solo jobs will get to you.\n        Some of the old timers used to say it was staring at the stars for too\n        long. Lots of scientists say it’s the cosmic radiation you get from\n        years in the suit. you, for one, am leaving the jury out on it for now.\n        Don’t signal to stop the bus unless you want to get off. The inner hull\n        was dark and cramped. Unlike the featureless outer hull, the inner hull\n        had tangles of equipment, pipes, and wires weaved through it. you had to\n        move and dodge as you moved along try to find the goal of your current\n        step in the mission. Now that you’d moved inside a bit, you could barely\n        see your hand in front of me in visible light. However, your suit could\n        see in a wide band of EM bands, so you could still see the contours of\n        it through your sixth sense, the image inferred through a synthesis of\n        heat, radio, and other sensors. you could make out the outline of a\n        panel on the inner hull. No power, no AR. No work. you opened up the\n        panel and grabbed the manual release lever. Not a big red button, but\n        you can work with it. you pumped the manual release lever using the\n        enhanced strength of the suit. The oil gushed through the system, moving\n        various parts of the system until you saw six pins around the circular\n        hatch pop out. you turned the lever and pushed in. The hatch itself\n        slowly started to float away from its mount. you pulled the lever on the\n        hatch to swing it open fully. you rushed towards the hatch. Inside, you\n        could see the pale green screen of the airlock hanging in the inky\n        black. “Ok, so the airlock is running on internal batteries only. you\n        repeat, ship appears to have no battery backups active. Airlocks are in\n        emergency mode.” you reached out of the airlock panel with your sixth\n        sense. For a second nothing happened. “Oh yeah. Emergency mode doesn’t\n        have enough power for AR.” you said to myself. you punched “FAST CYCLE”\n        on the airlock. The outside hatch automatically started to close. you\n        jerked it close and turned the lever. As it locked, you hear a thin,\n        high ‘beep’ as the airlock cycled. “SAM--check atmospheric content.” No\n        need to waste vacuum time if you don’t have to. you waited for a few\n        seconds. “SAM?” Apparently he took the command to turn himself off\n        pretty seriously. Or he’s ignoring me. He sure is acting weird today.\n        you looked down at your wrist through AR. you could see a readout for\n        the atmosphere sensors. you added it all up in your head and nodded to\n        myself. As you clicked the helmet off, the AR overview slide away.\n        Without the helmet muffing the sounds around me--that’s when you\n        realized what was was bugging me about this ship. It was completely\n        silent. you’d been inside powered down ships before, but never one with\n        all the batteries drained like this. Every ship has large battery backup\n        units and solar panels which automatically deploy in the event of main\n        engine power failures. Without your helmet’s displays and sensors, My\n        world changed from bright and multicolored to pitch black. The panel on\n        the airlock cast a small pool of green light around me, sending out deep\n        shadows. There’s an old saying among spacers. ‘Just as a body without\n        breath is a corpse, a ship without power is a coffin.’ Sitting in the\n        quiet of the ship, you felt a chill go down your spine as you remembered\n        this saying. But you had a job to do, and you wasn’t going to let\n        something like that get the better of me. “CAPCOM, ship is completely\n        dark. you’ve never seen a ship so drained. She must have been on the\n        float for a while, huh? The emergency solars must not have deployed.\n        you’m going to head to engineering to see if you can get some power in\n        here.”\n      </Text>\n      <ChapterEnd />\n    </Section>\n  </Chapter>\n);\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Typography from \"@material-ui/core/Typography\";\n\nexport default ({ children }) => (\n  <Typography align=\"center\" variant=\"h1\">\n    {children}\n  </Typography>\n);\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Typography from \"@material-ui/core/Typography\";\n\nexport default ({ children }) => (\n  <Typography align=\"center\" variant=\"h4\">\n    {children}\n  </Typography>\n);\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Chapter, { ChapterEnd } from \"../components/Chapter\";\nimport Section from \"../components/Section\";\nimport Text from \"../components/Text\";\nimport Goto from \"../components/Goto\";\nimport WaitForInput from \"../components/WaitForInput\";\nimport Title from \"../components/Title\";\nimport Subtitle from \"../components/Subtitle\";\nimport NL from \"../components/Newline\";\n\nconst Intro = props => (\n  <Chapter entry=\"title-page\" {...props}>\n    <Section uid=\"title-page\">\n      <Text>\n        <Title>Fenris</Title>\n        <NL />\n        <Subtitle>By Jon Monroe</Subtitle>\n      </Text>\n      <WaitForInput>Start</WaitForInput>\n      <Goto section=\"help-text\" />\n    </Section>\n    <Section uid=\"help-text\">\n      <Text>\n        The following is an interactive narrative experience.\n        <NL />\n        The application automatically saves your progress.\n        <NL />\n        Blue buttons indicate choices you can make.\n        <NL />\n        Red buttons indicate checkpoints you can restart from.\n        <NL />\n      </Text>\n      <WaitForInput>I understand</WaitForInput>\n      <ChapterEnd />\n    </Section>\n  </Chapter>\n);\n\nexport default Intro;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Chapter from \"../components/Chapter\";\nimport Section from \"../components/Section\";\nimport Text from \"../components/Text\";\n\nconst End = props => (\n  <Chapter entry=\"end\" {...props}>\n    <Section uid=\"end\">\n      <Text>To Be Continued!</Text>\n    </Section>\n  </Chapter>\n);\n\nexport default End;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport Story from \"../components/Story\";\n\nimport ChapterOne from \"./ChapterOne\";\nimport Intro from \"./Intro\";\nimport End from \"./End\";\n\nexport default () => (\n  <Story>\n    <Intro />\n    <ChapterOne />\n    <End />\n  </Story>\n);\n","import { createMuiTheme } from \"@material-ui/core/styles\";\nimport blueGrey from \"@material-ui/core/colors/blueGrey\";\n\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  palette: {\n    primary: { main: \"#005276\" },\n    secondary: { main: \"#BB2400\" },\n    background: { default: blueGrey[800] }\n  },\n  typography: {\n    fontFamily:\n      \"Courier New,Courier,Lucida Sans Typewriter,Lucida Typewriter,monospace\",\n    h1: {\n      fontSize: \"5rem\"\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nexport default theme;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
